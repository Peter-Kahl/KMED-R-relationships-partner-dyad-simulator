KMED-R (Relationships) formalises epistemic dynamics within intimate partnerships and other dyadic relationships.
It extends the _Kahl Model of Epistemic Dissonance_ (KMED) from developmental to interpersonal psychology, showing how recognition, suppression, repair, and fiduciary quality shape epistemic life.

The model captures three interacting epistemic variables:
‚Ä¢	Epistemic Autonomy (EA) ‚Äì persistence in signalling contradiction
‚Ä¢	Dissonance Tolerance (DT) ‚Äì capacity to withstand contradiction
‚Ä¢	Dependence (D) ‚Äì reliance on suppression versus recognition

KMED-R thus provides a computational theatre for exploring epistemic clientelism, resilience, and trust, bridging intimate relationships with broader institutional and organisational applications.

## 1. Documentation & Conceptual Background

This repository contains the official Python implementation of KMED-R (Relationships): Partner Dyad Simulator, reproducing the simulations presented in the paper:

Kahl, P. (2025). Epistemic Clientelism in Intimate Relationships: The Kahl Model of Epistemic Dissonance (KMED) and the Foundations of Epistemic Psychology.
Lex et Ratio Ltd, London.
GitHub Repository

Each simulation represents a stylised relational policy‚Äîfiduciary, inconsistent, avoidant, coercive, reparative, or mutual‚Äîmodelled as a sequence of recognition (œÅ), suppression (œÉ), fiduciary containment (œï), and repair (œÄ) events.

These are not empirical data but qualitative epistemic archetypes, illustrating how ethical care modulates autonomy, tolerance, and dependence.
